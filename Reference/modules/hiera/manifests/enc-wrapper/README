# *** This is a wrapper purely used for ENC, and we can migrate back to param class when the ENC GUI,
# *** (foreman/dashboard) supports them.
#
# This directory contains all the wrapper classes to use specifically with ENC (foreman/dashboard)
#
# This is due to ENC's yaml output not containing hashes of parameters when a parameterized class is used.
#
# Because we are heavily using param classes since 2.6.x and they are considerbly beneficial I am 
# keeping them and will wait for the ENC and foreman/dashboard GUI to support them.
#
# Wrappers will contain a param class and pull variables from top scope:
#
# We will try and keep variable naming unique to its original i.e
# class -> puppet::client already contains a param variable "$puppet_environment".
# our wrapper class puppet::enc-wrapper::client will reference the now top scope variable "$::puppet-client-puppet_enviroment"
#
# All top scope variables used in the wrapper classes will need to be documented in the wrapper class,
# these then get used in the ENC as smart variables (foreman) or parameters (dashboard).
#
# class <module-name>::<enc-dir-name>::<class-name> {
#  class { 'puppet::client':
#   puppet_environment => $::<class-name>-<variable-name>,
#  }
# }
#
# Example:
# class puppet::enc-wrapper::client {
#  class { 'puppet::client':
#	puppet_environment => $::puppet-client-puppet_environment,
#	}
# }
